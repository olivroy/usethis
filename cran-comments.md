### New problems

* circle
  This package makes reference to a function that is now removed from usethis.
  This function has been hard-deprecated (i.e. throws an error with advice on
  how to update) since usethis v2.2.0, released in December 2020.
  I have opened an issue in circle's GitHub repository.

* exampletestr
  This package has a brittle test that checks for exact wording of an error
  message originating in usethis.
  That test fails because usethis's error message has changed slightly.
  I have opened an issue in exampletestr's GitHub repository.
